# Speedometer-MK2
This is the updated version of the previous speedometer. This speedometer reads from a CSV file like the old one but uses Tkinter for the UI. This is intended for the user interface.

This project is still a work in progress but will soon be operational, this repo is just for backing up my data

If you want a working version go to speedometer MK1
